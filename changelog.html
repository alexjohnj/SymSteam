		<h1>Ch-Ch-Changes</h1>
		<h2>0.1.5</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Added a basic, potentially buggy, preferences window that allows you to change the location of the local and symbolic SteamApps folders.</li>
			<li>Improved drive management. SymSteam now keeps track of which drives aren't steam drives far better and won't rename the SteamApps folder if a non steam drive is unplugged whilst a steam drive is still plugged in.</li>
			<li>Slightly sped up searching of drives for a SteamApps folder.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>0.1</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>First release</li>
			</ul>
