## 0.2

- Growl notifications for a variety of events in the application. 
- Total rewrite of the underlying logic. The setup of SymSteam has been greatly simplified and the management of connected drives has been improved greatly. 

## 0.1.5

- Added a basic, potentially buggy, preferences window that allows you to change the location of the local and symbolic SteamApps folders. 
- Improved drive management. SymSteam now keeps track of which drives aren't steam drives far better and won't rename the SteamApps folder if a non steam drive is unplugged whilst a steam drive is still plugged in. 
- Slightly sped up searching of drives for a SteamApps folder.
